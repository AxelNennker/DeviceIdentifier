  version: 0.0.0
  description: |
     The Device Identifier API return details about the device (i.e. UE) currently being used by a specified mobile subscriber. The following information can be returned:
     - A unique network identifier for the specific device itself (IMEI SV and IMEI)
     - A network identifier for the device make and model (IMEI Type Allocation Code)
     - Device manufacturer name
     - Device manufacturer model
     
     Information for the manufacturer name and model will, where provided, be taken from the [GSMA IMEI database](https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/workinggroups/terminal-steering-group/imei-database)
